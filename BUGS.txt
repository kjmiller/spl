Try to keep this up to date:

(0) Is the SSVM actually getting solved?
(1) No command line processing at all. (This should be modded out, so both
train.py and eventually test.py can use the same command line args)
(1a) No writing things to disk.
(1b) No test.py (but I think after 1 and 1a this should be easy)
(2) We should make the boundary between the API (things in the basedir) and
things in 'implementation/' more clear, which can do simply by changing the
includes. If this doesn't make sense to you, don't worry about it at all.
(3) params shouldn't have access to examples because examples is mutable.
Right?
(4) The caching is a little bit wrong for psi - caching should only depend on
LV and we should make the right psi vector based on what we have.
(5) No impute latent variables.
(6) No biases.
(7) No SPM.
